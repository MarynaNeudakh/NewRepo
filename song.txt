In the town, where I was born
Lived a man, who sailed the sea
And he told, us of his life
In the land, of submarines

So we sailed, up to the sun
’Til we found, the sea of green.
And we lived, beneath the waves
In our Yellow, Submarine

Chorus
We all live in a yellow submarine,
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine.
We all live in a yellow submarine,
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine.

And our friend, are all on board
Many more of them, live next door.
And the band, begins to play…

Chorus (See Above)

As we live, a life of ease
Every one of us, has all we need:
Sky of blue, and sea of green
In our Yellow, Submarine

Chorus (See Above, Fade Out)
